* How does my gem take advantage of Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities

1) Dynamically generate methods attached to the String class from a list
of methods names and the corresponding color codes using 'send' and
'define_method'
2) Dynamically call these methods using 'send' to demonstrate the colors
that the methods apply.

* How long
About three hours, but quite a bit of time was wasted on the define_method
part until I worked it out.

* Most rewarding
Getting it working, and getting it nice and clean

* Room to grow
Some practice on the method_missing concept would help bed understanding down.
